Pendulum Period Calculator

This project calculates the period of a simple based on the length of the pendulum arm.

## Formula
The formula used is:

T = 2π * √(L/g)

Where:

- T is the period
- L is the length (in meters)
- g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s**2)

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then:

\'\'\'bash
python main.py
\'\'\'
